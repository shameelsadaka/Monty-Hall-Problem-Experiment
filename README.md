# Monty-Hall-Problem-Experiment

Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Believe it or not, it’s actually to your benefit to switch:

If you switch, you have roughly a 2/3 chance of winning the car.
If you stick to your original choice you have roughly a 1/3 chance of winning the car.
The answer sounds unlikely. After door 3 is opened, you would think that you then have two doors to choose from both with the same odds. However, you are actually much more likely to win if you switch.

Those who switched doors won about 2/3 of the time
Those who didn’t switch won about 1/3 of the time

## Verifiying the solution by simulation

I had verified the solution using a python program by iteratively running the experiment and it is observed that you will win almost 2/3 times on every experiments if you switch.
